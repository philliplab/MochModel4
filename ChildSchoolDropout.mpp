//LABEL(ChildSchoolDropout, EN) Controls when children drops out of school

/* NOTE(ChildSchoolDropout, EN)
	This module controls when a child drops out of school. The transition is
	based on the dropout probability of the child in each year and in each
	disease state of its mother.

	- Data Requirements

	The dropout probabilities for children must be specified by age and by
	socio_economic class. The effect of the mother's disease and the child's
	gender must be specified in the form of factors that the probabilities
	are multiplied by.

	- Implementation Details

	This event is first scheduled the moment when the child enters school. The event is
	then rescheduled whenever one of the indices of the dropout rates table changes or
	one of the indices for the multiplicative factors changes (mother's disease state). The
	child's gender and socioeconomic status cannot change in this model. The event is thus rescheduled 
	every year when the child ages and everytime the mother's disease state changes.

	The event is simply scheduled by drawing a random number from a uniform distribution
	and dividing it by the dropout probability of the child.

	In the case where the mother's disease progresses, the child's age will not be an integer.
	This special case is handled by scheduling the child's dropout using the child's age
	rounded down to the nearest integer to lookup the child's dropout probability. 
	The event is then scheduled as previously.
