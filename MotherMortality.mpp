//LABEL(MotherMortality, EN) Mortality functions for Mothers

/* NOTE(MotherMortality, EN)
	This module contains all the mortality functions for the mothers. There
	are three different types of mortality implemented:

	- Mortality for Healthy Mothers
	- Mortality for Infected Mothers
	- Mortality for Treated Mothers

	Mortality for Healthy Mothers

	- Data requirements

    The q[x,y] values (probability of dying between ages x and x+1 given that you
	survived until age x in the year y) by gender and time (model year). These
	mortality rates must exclude mortality due to HIV. 

	- Implementation Details

	Mortality from the healthy state is implemented by asking the question: 
	Given the mothers current age and the time specified in the model, when
	will the mother die? This is (-log(RandUniform()) / -log(1 - qstar[integer_age, model_time])).

	When the mother ages 1 year, the question is asked again, this time the
	answer is again (-log(RandUniform()) / -log(1 - qstar[integer_age, model_time])) (But 
	integer_age is now one more). This process is continued until the mother leaves the 
	healthy state (at which time another mortality function will be used), or the mother 
	dies before her next birth day.

	The qstar[x,y] is q[x,y] value is multiplied by HealthyMortalityMotherMultiplier.

	Mortality for Infected Mothers
