# Tests for Model Version 47

Notes on the organization of the tests:
- If a test involves a child in any way, it goes in the child section.
- If a test involves only one transition, then it goes into that transition's section. This includes test that only test the effect of one parameter. If that parameter is specifically associated with only one transition, then the test goes there.
- Any other test goes under the heading of the scenario it uses.
- If a test does not fit any of these categories, dump it in the General section.

## Mother - Transitions

### Transition 1 - Death of Uninfected Mothers

#### <a name="NodeathsfromhealthyinOnlyInfectedMortality"></a>No deaths from healthy in OnlyInfectedMortality

Scenario(s): OnlyInfectedMortality

No mothers should die from the Healthy state in the OnlyInfectedMortality Scenario

**Result: TRUE**

#### <a name="HealthyMortalityMatchInputs"></a>Healthy Mortality Match Inputs

Scenario(s): NoHIV

When the kaplan meier curves of the healthy mortalities are compared to the input ASSA mortalities, then they must be similar. 

Note that the input parameters are not perfectly translated into a curve. This can be optimized in the future, but I believe it is good enough for a quick check.

### Transition 5 - Diagnosis of Asymptomatic Mothers
#### <a name="AsymptomaticExponentialDiagnosisRatesmatchesinputs"></a>Asymptomatic Exponential Diagnosis Rates matches inputs

Scenario(s): AllInfectedNoSympNoMortExpDiag

When the kaplan meier curves of the asymptomatic diagnosis rates are compared to the input values, they should look similar. This is only for the case where the transition is based on the exponential distribution

#### <a name="AsymptomaticPercentageDiagnosisRatesmatchesinputs"></a>Asymptomatic Percentage Diagnosis Rates matches inputs

Scenario(s): Base

The percentage of mothers who become diagnosed while asymptomatic must match the input rate. 

This test is only for the case where the transition is based on a percentage and not on a exponential curve.

### Transition 6 - Diagnosis of Symptomatic Mothers
#### <a name="SymptomaticExponentialDiagnosisRatesmatchesinputs"></a>Symptomatic Exponential Diagnosis Rates matches inputs

Scenario(s): AllSymptomsNoMortExpDiag

When the kaplan meier curves of the symptomatic diagnosis rates are compared to the input values, they should look similar. This is only for the case where the transition is based on the exponential distribution

**Result: TRUE**

### Transition 7 - Treatment rate of Eligible Mothers

#### <a name="TreatmentRatesmatchesinputs"></a>Treatment Rates matches inputs

Scenario(s): AllInfectedNoMortality

 Scenario(s): WeibullTreatmentTransition

When the kaplan meier curves of the treatment rates are compared to the input values, they should look similar. 

When the treatment coverage rate approach is used to assign treatment, it should be a step function with the majority of the transitions happening at time 0.01. Then much smaller steps at 1.01, 2.01, .... (depending on how the treatment coverage rate fluctuates) 

If the weibull transition is used, then the KM curve should look like a weibull curve. A red line will show the curve constructed from the input parameters.

**Result: Manual**

#### <a name="Treatmentchanceisassignedasexpected"></a>Treatment chance is assigned as expected

Scenario(s): Base

The treatment chance must be a random uniform number. Min between 0 and 0.05, Max between 0.95 and 1, Mean between 0.475 and 0.525

[To Summary Table](#summary_tab_link)

## [1] 0.5036
```
  

**Result: TRUE**  

---

#### <a name="TreatmentCoverageRateMatchesInputRate"></a>Treatment Coverage Rate Matches Input Rate

Scenario(s): AllInfectedNoMortality

Plots showing the treatment coverage rates. 

The line shows how many mothers started treatment at a given age vs how many mothers became eligible at a given age. 

If the Treatment coverage rate transition is used, then the line must reflect the treatment coverage rate for the given age. Note that the variability increases drastically as the number of mothers who become eligible decreases.

If the weibull transition is used, then the line should increase with age since the probability of going on treatment increases with time spent in the eligible state. This is not really meaningful. One should rather look at the 'Treatment Rate of Eligible Mothers' test.

### Transition 8 - Death of Treated Mothers

#### <a name="TreatedMortalityMatchInputs"></a>Treated Mortality Match Inputs

Scenario(s): OnlyTreatedMortality

When the kaplan meier curves of the treated mortalities are compared to the input ASSA mortalities, then they must be similar. 

This mortality rate is way too low. It causes mother's to hit the 100 age cap - hence the output is much lower than the input. A censored survival curve should take care of this. However, just fixing the treated mortality to be realistic will also work.

[To Summary Table](#summary_tab_link)  
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-29](figure/unnamed-chunk-29.png) 
  

**Result: FALSE**

#### <a name="NodeathsfromTreatedinOnlyStoppedMortality"></a>No deaths from Treated in OnlyStoppedMortality

Scenario(s): OnlyStoppedMortality

No mothers should die from the Treated state in the OnlyStoppedMortality Scenario

[To Summary Table](#summary_tab_link)  

```
##                                  metrics    ..1

```
  

**Result: TRUE**

### Transition 9 - Treatment cessation

#### <a name="TreatmentCessationRatesmatchesinputs"></a>Treatment Cessation Rates matches inputs

Scenario(s): AllStopped

When the kaplan meier curves of the treatment stoppage rates are compared to the input values, they should look similar. 

The same issues as with the treated mortality of the mothers. However, the cessation rates will never be high enough, so this plot will never match the input. To fix it, introduce censoring.

### Transition 10 - Death of Stopped Mothers

Just select a couple of dropout rates from the big multidimensional array and make sure they are what you expect them to be. 

Note that there is an issue with the modgenTester R package. It does not read the Age dimension fully - it chops off the first couple of years. However, this is definitely just an R issue.

## Child - General

#### <a name="ChildGenderRatios"></a>Child Gender Ratios

Scenario(s): Base

The input and output gender ratios of the children must be similar. The input ratio over the output ratio must be between 0.975 and 1.025.
